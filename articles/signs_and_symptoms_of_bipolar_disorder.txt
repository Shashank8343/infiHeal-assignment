Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition characterized by extreme mood swings that include emotional highs (mania or hypomania) and lows (depression). These mood changes can significantly impact a person's daily life, affecting relationships, work, and overall functioning.

Manic or Hypomanic Episodes:
During manic or hypomanic episodes, individuals may experience elevated mood, increased energy levels, and heightened activity. Symptoms can include:

Excessive talking or racing thoughts
Inflated self-esteem or grandiosity
Decreased need for sleep
Impulsive or risky behaviors, such as excessive spending or risky sexual activities
Irritability or agitation
Manic episodes are more severe and may require hospitalization, while hypomanic episodes are less intense but can still cause noticeable disruptions in daily life.

Depressive Episodes:
In depressive episodes, individuals may feel persistently sad, empty, or hopeless. Symptoms can include:

Persistent feelings of sadness or emptiness
Loss of interest or pleasure in activities once enjoyed
Changes in appetite or weight
Difficulty sleeping or sleeping too much
Fatigue or loss of energy
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive guilt
Difficulty concentrating or making decisions
Thoughts of death or suicide
Bipolar disorder often presents in late adolescence or early adulthood, but symptoms can vary widely among individuals. Effective treatment typically involves a combination of medication and psychotherapy to help manage symptoms and stabilize mood.

If you or someone you know is exhibiting symptoms of bipolar disorder, seeking professional help from a mental health provider is essential for proper diagnosis and treatment.
